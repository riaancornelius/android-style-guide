# Style guide

This is an attempt to formalise the style I use for my code. This will be a living set of documents as I figure out what I missed.

I'm also planning on adding some performance / memory guidelines. 

## Java style guide

Since Android is basically Java, having a separate Java style guide seemed to make sense:

## Android style guide

[Android style guide](https://github.com/riaancornelius/android-style-guide/blob/master/Android-style-guide.md)


### Useful resources:

These were used to form the basis of my style guides:

- [Google's coding standards for source code in the Javaâ„¢ Programming Language](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- [Android code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) for contributors
- [Ribot Android project and code guidelines](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_and_code_guidelines.md)

Some really good performance information here:
