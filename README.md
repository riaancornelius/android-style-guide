# Style guide

This is an attempt to formalise the style I use for my code. This will be a living set of documents as I figure out what I missed.

These are mainly a summary of all the things I consider important when creating high quality Android apps. There are a lot of resources out there already, but it's not always easy to get a high level overview.

These docs aim to be that high level overview with lots of links to things like Google's coding standards for Java, the contributors style guide for the AOSP and things like Chet Haase's excellent guide to 'Developing for Android' on Medium.com (see the _Useful resources_ section at the end of this doc).

## Java style guide

Since Android is basically Java, having a separate Java style guide seemed to make sense:

## Android style guide

[Android style guide](https://github.com/riaancornelius/android-style-guide/blob/master/Android-style-guide.md)

## Best practices

These mainly consider performance, memory management and battery / internet usage as these are the main contributors to a great user experience.

### Useful resources:

These were used to form the basis of my style guides:

- [Google's coding standards for source code in the Javaâ„¢ Programming Language](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- [Android code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) for contributors
- [Ribot Android project and code guidelines](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_and_code_guidelines.md)

Some really good performance information here:

- [Developing for Android](https://medium.com/google-developers/developing-for-android-introduction-5345b451567c#.1f21f4ynd) by Chet Haase published on Medium.com

Lots of great videos:
